                                <strong><br></strong><br><strong>Circuit Design (Project 1.2.6)</strong></h5>
                            <h6 class="card-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-3 display-4">October 2024</h6>
                            <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">
Our goal for the P1.2.6 Circuit Design project was to create a traffic control system that could handle a small-scale intersection in real time. The idea was to use basic combinational and sequential logic to dynamically manage car traffic and pedestrian crossings based on their presence. The system would simulate real-world functionality using logic gates, LEDs, and flip-flops to ensure traffic flowed efficiently and safely.
<br><br>
At the start, I was very interested in creating flip-flops using NAND gates to store information about active traffic and pedestrian signals. I thought it would be a cool way to build our own variables from scratch and make the project more unique; it quickly became clear that this approach was way too ambitious for the tools we had available. Trying to cram that level of complexity onto a breadboard would take far more time and resources than we had available to us, so I had to dial it back focus on using direct user input rather than variables, which let us focus on getting the rest of the circuit working.
<br><br>
Despite careful planning in the simulation part of the project (using Multisim), the project encountered significant challenges. During the presentation, the timing portion of the circuit failed to function due to a malfunctioning AND gate, which disrupted our ability to showcase its functionality in its entirety. After the presentation, the issue was resolved by replacing the faulty component, at which point the system performed as designed. Reflecting on this experience, we should have finished earlier to do rigorous physical testing and redundancy checks to prevent similar issues in the future. The presentation itself could also have benefited from better preparation in terms of organizing the flow and clearly assigning speaking roles.
<br><br>
The design incorporated various features to manage the intersection effectively. Combinational logic, utilizing AND gates, OR gates, and inverters, ensured that vehicles could only proceed in one direction at a time. Similarly, crosswalk lights were activated only when no vehicles were detected on the corresponding street. The sequential logic component included a 15-second pedestrian crossing timer implemented with a divide-by-two circuit and flip-flops, making sure pedestrians have enough time to cross the intersection. This integration of sequential and combinational logic required careful consideration of the system's physical implementation, especially in differences between timers in the simulation and on the breadboard.
<br><br>
In the project, my specific responsibilities were outlining the logic for the program in the documentation (linked below), handling the combinational logic component of the simulation/design, and building the project on a breadboard. Despite the setbacks, this project taught me a lot about being realistic with design goals and adapting when things don’t go as planned.  While my original vision of constructing flip-flops from NAND gates was not feasible, adapting to the constraints instead of spending all of our time on one part allowed us to deliver a working prototype. It also reminded me that good organization and preparation are just as important as the technical side of a project—-even more so when working on a team.
<br><br>
Overall, this project was a valuable learning experience that taught me the importance of adapting to challenges and balancing my ambition with practicality. Despite some setbacks, like the faulty AND gate during the presentation, seeing our traffic control system work helped my understanding of circuit design and problem-solving. It was rewarding to turn an idea into a functional system and explore how what I've been learning can be, and has been, applied to real-world challenges like traffic control.</p>

                                <strong><br></strong><br><strong>Printed Circuit Board Design (Project 2.2.6)</strong></h5>
                            <h6 class="card-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-3 display-4">February–March 2025</h6>
                            <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">
For Project 2.2.6, our objective was to take a circuit of our own design and turn it into a working printed circuit board (PCB). I chose to build a gas detection platform using a suite of MQ sensors to detect air quality, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen gas. The idea was to create a low-power system that could monitor gases in the background and trigger immediate alerts if dangerous conditions were detected. This meant integrating both analog and digital sensing, logic gates, and an ESP32 microcontroller into a compact, fabricated circuit.
<br><br>
The core of the project was based around three MQ sensors--the MQ135, MQ5, and MQ8--each tuned for different gases. The analog outputs were sent to the ESP32 for long-term data logging, while the digital outputs were wired through a series of AND and OR gates to turn on indicator LEDs. Each LED had a specific purpose: yellow for any gas detection, red for all three, and blue for fire-related gases without hydrogen present. The logic made sense in theory, and even worked during breadboard testing--but transferring it to a PCB turned out to be a much harder task than expected.
<br><br>
Most of the problems came during the fabrication phase. When I etched the board, large areas of copper didn’t dissolve properly. I initially thought the ferric chloride was too saturated, but it turned out I hadn’t cleaned the copper thoroughly before printing the mask. I also didn’t give myself enough spacing margins on the board, which led to fit issues with the ESP32 and caused some of the traces to be fragile near the edges. Several traces ended up scratched or entirely disconnected, and I had to repair them using a mix of solid-core and multi-core wire--not ideal, but the best option available at the time.
<br><br>
In the end, only one of the sensors--the MQ5--actually powered on, and even that one didn’t produce the correct LED output. After testing continuity across the board, I realized that almost every critical trace had been damaged at some point, either from poor etching or from mechanical stress while soldering. I managed to jump a few connections, but there simply wasn’t room to fix them all. Still, the process of troubleshooting, cutting wires to size, and figuring out where everything went taught me more than any simulation could have.
<br><br>
My main responsibilities included designing the circuit schematic in Fusion 360, optimizing the layout to reduce jumpers, handling the fabrication process, and soldering all components. I also designed a workaround to replace a NOT gate IC with a single-transistor inverter when I ran out of space for another chip--something that made me realize how flexible and adaptable circuit design can be when needed. Even though the final board didn’t function fully, it was still a rewarding experience to hold something I designed from scratch.
<br><br>
This project reminded me that real-world implementation is rarely clean or perfect--and that problems with power, fit, and trace integrity often matter more than the theoretical design. Next time, I’d start with a smaller test circuit, clean the copper thoroughly, and double-check all component pinouts before routing. Still, getting the chance to take a design from idea to physical board--and dealing with everything that went wrong along the way--was one of the most valuable hands-on experiences I’ve had so far.
