                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">
                    During my time in high school, I have gained work experience through building collaborative programming and hardware projects with companies. Near the end of 8th grade, I travelled to Louisiana to intern at <a href="https://geninf.com/" class="text-primary">General Informatics</a>. At General Informatics, I built several Windows servers and was responsible for setting up RAID (data storage virtualization). I did not know exactly how to set up RAID before this experience, so I learned how to do so. At the same time, however, I also learned about the importance of asking questions in a professional environment. There was no shame in asking even the most basic of questions there - I was told that it is better that you make the initial investment of asking questions so you can accomplish your assigned tasks without any hiccups.<br></p>

                    I also interned at <a href="https://www.365labs.com/" class="text-primary">365Labs</a> where I designed and programmed parts of a web interface for the public to interact with police departments. In this experience, I learned about the importance of clear communication. Most of the team I was a part of using Slack or email, so it was inevitable that I would have learn how to communicate clearly.<br><br>During my freshman year, I learned to utilize my connections and was able to land an internship at Aviato, who's CTO was a former DHS student. This experience, while it also pertained to programming, was very different than 365Labs. Aviato was a startup, while 365Labs was an established company. Aviato was much more fast paced and relaxed than 365Labs - the goal was push out a product, not necessarily dress in a suit before every online call. While this experience was a lot more free flowing and "easy" in terms of non-programming interactions, I found that the work was much more demanding. Also, sometimes the chaos associated with startups and a lack of communication got frustrating.<br><br>Comparing my experiences with Aviato and 365Labs, I cannot say I like one environment (professional company vs. startup) better. The fast paced work at Aviato felt a lot more natural to me as a high schooler, but the lack of programming etiquette and priority on speed made the work stressful and not as satisfying. In contrast, 365Labs was very structured and at the end of the day I felt proud of what I had written - even if it was not much. These experienced have led me to plan how I desire to work in a fast-paced startup environment during college and right after, where I am still flexible financial with no family to take care of. However, once I having real adult burdens, I desire to work a job at a corporate company.</p>

                    Career Research</h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">During Principles of Engineering, I had the privilege to explore careers that match my interests. My top three careers were all engineering - industrial engineers, fire-prevention and protection engineers, and logistics engineers. All of these job interest me due to their balance between STEM skills and people skills. While one part of my job would be to to things such as design supply lines, optimize their cost, and analyze data to improve quality and reliability, another part of my job would be to communicate the aforementioned information to my coworkers, bosses, and clients/vendors. This balance would make day-to-day work very feasible, as I would not get bored working with people and technology.&nbsp;<br>I also explored how these careers relate to my geographical position, living in the San Francisco Bay Area. I learned that many EV companies local to the area are hiring industrial/logistics engineers to build their supply chains out, as well as fire-prevention engineers due to the very real risk of a battery meltdown in an electric vehicle. This leads me to believe that all of these jobs have a good amount of job security and will only be more and more important in the future.&nbsp;<br>Due to my experience and passion for CS, I hope to combine supply chain logistics and CS to optimize global supply chains. Quantum computers are currently being used by EV companies to calculate ideal battery chemistries, but I believe they can be applied to larger issues regarding manufacturing and fire-safety chemicals.</p>
