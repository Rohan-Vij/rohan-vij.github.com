                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">
                    During my time in high school, I have gained work experience through building collaborative programming and hardware projects with companies. Near the end of 8th grade, I travelled to Louisiana to intern at <a href="https://geninf.com/" class="text-primary">General Informatics</a>. At General Informatics, I built several Windows servers and was responsible for setting up RAID (data storage virtualization). I did not know exactly how to set up RAID before this experience, so I learned how to do so. At the same time, however, I also learned about the importance of asking questions in a professional environment. There was no shame in asking even the most basic of questions there - I was told that it is better that you make the initial investment of asking questions so you can accomplish your assigned tasks without any hiccups.<br></p>

                    I also interned at <a href="https://www.365labs.com/" class="text-primary">365Labs</a> where I designed and programmed parts of a web interface for the public to interact with police departments. hrough this experience, I learned the importance of clear communication. Most of the team relied on Slack or email, so it was inevitable that I had to learn how to communicate effectively.<br><br>During my freshman year, I learned to leverage my connections and landed an internship at <a href="https://www.aviato.co/" class="text-primary" target="_blank">Aviato</a>, whose CTO was a former DHS student. While this experience also involved programming, it was very different from 365Labs. Aviato was a startup, whereas 365Labs was an established company. Aviato was much more fast-paced and relaxed--the focus was on pushing out a product, not dressing in a suit for every online call. Although the environment felt more casual and “easy” in terms of non-programming interactions, I found the work itself to be much more demanding. At times, the chaos and lack of communication common in startups became frustrating.<br><br>Comparing my experiences at Aviato and 365Labs, I can’t say I prefer one environment over the other. The fast-paced nature of Aviato felt more natural to me as a high schooler, but the lack of programming etiquette and the intense focus on speed often made the work stressful and less satisfying. In contrast, 365Labs was highly structured, and even if I didn’t write a lot of code each day, I felt genuinely proud of what I contributed. These experiences have shaped my current outlook: I plan to work in a fast-paced startup environment during college and shortly after, while I’m still financially flexible and have no family obligations. However, once I take on more adult responsibilities, I envision transitioning to a role at a corporate company.<br><br>In my junior year, I received a full scholarship to attend the annual AI Conference in San Francisco. There, I had the opportunity to meet prominent figures in AI, including the co-founders of Anthropic, a lead researcher at Google, and the CTO of Nvidia. During the two-day event, I spent as much time as possible networking and trying to build connections that could lead to internships or job opportunities.<br><br>On the second (and final) day, I met Gaurav Vij (we’re not related--we just happened to notice we shared the same last name, a happy coincidence!), the CTO of <a href="https://monsterapi.ai/" class="text-primary" target="_blank">MonsterAPI</a>. MonsterAPI is a company focused on fine-tuning and retraining large language models, with a unique value proposition: offering cheaper services by running on spare compute power rented from underutilized data centers. I initially worked on documentation for their Python APIs and wrote promotional articles, but my experience really took off when I joined the sales and business development team. As the company prepared for its next funding round, they needed to demonstrate viability to both companies and investors. I used tools like Apollo.io and participated in sales calls with various small to medium-sized tech companies to pitch MonsterAPI as a cost-effective solution for their LLM needs.<br><br>Although my time at MonsterAPI wasn’t heavily technical, I’m grateful I explored other roles in the tech industry. If I want to build my own startup one day, having both technical expertise and a solid understanding of sales and investment will be invaluable in becoming a well-rounded, effective leader.<br><br><br></p>

                    Career Research</h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">During Principles of Engineering, I had the privilege to explore careers that matched my interests. My top three careers were all engineering--industrial engineers, fire-prevention and protection engineers, and logistics engineers. All of these jobs interested me due to their balance between STEM skills and people skills. While one part of the job involves tasks like designing supply lines, optimizing cost, and analyzing data to improve quality and reliability, another part requires communicating that information to coworkers, supervisors, and clients or vendors. This balance would make day-to-day work engaging and sustainable, as I wouldn’t get bored working with both people and technology.<br><br>I also explored how these careers relate to my geographical position, living in the San Francisco Bay Area. I learned that many EV companies in the region are hiring industrial/logistics engineers to build out their supply chains, as well as fire-prevention engineers due to the very real risk of battery meltdowns in electric vehicles. This led me to believe these jobs offer good security and will become increasingly important in the future.<br><br>Since that initial exploration, my interests have taken a more defined shape. While working on electronics for my POE entrepreneurship project, I found myself drawn more deeply into electrical engineering. That interest more firmly established itself when I applied to the UC Davis COSMOS program, specifically the Internet of Things cluster--a course that combined electrical engineering and computer science. COSMOS was the best month of my life; It was the first time I felt completely immersed in something I loved, and I was constantly surrounded by passionate peers and mentors. We worked long days, diving into embedded systems and wireless communication, but it never felt like a chore. That experience was so formative that I dropped AP Research to take Digital Electronics my senior year.<br><br>Taking Digital Electronics confirmed what COSMOS had already shown me: I want to work on hardware. Whether designing circuits, building embedded systems, or writing low-level code, I feel most passionate about combining physical technology and software. I’ll be studying Computer Engineering in college next year to continue pursuing this passion.<br><br>Beyond engineering, I’ve always carried a fascination with space and nuclear energy. As a kid, I used to dream about becoming an astronaut---a dream encouraged by frequent visits to the Chabot Space &amp; Science Center and late nights watching space documentaries. More recently, I’ve been inspired by the work being done at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), where I had the chance to hear a talk from one of their scientists. Seeing how LLNL contributes to both fusion research and national security--especially through work at the National Ignition Facility--reignited my childhood interest in nuclear energy. The future of clean power lies in harnessing the atom, and I want to be part of that energy revolution.<br><br>I know that to pursue either space exploration or nuclear energy in a meaningful way, I’ll likely need to go beyond a bachelor’s degree. A master’s degree seems like a natural step, and I’m already planning for it. I want to be someone who not only builds technology, but also understands its broader impact--on energy, sustainability, and the future of life on Earth and beyond.<br></p>

                    Guest Speaker #1: Laura Kegelmeyer</h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">
                    The most impactful guest speaker I have listened to in my four years of engineering at Dublin High was a talk by Laura Kegelmeyer, a scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). She detailed her time at the lab, from her research in using machine learning to find cancer to eventually using that knowledge in the National Ignition Facility's laser equipment. Her journey began with automating microscopes in the biosciences division, which led to a project on breast cancer detection. She repurposed a digitizer originally developed for the weapons program to convert X-ray images into digital data--what she called “From Bombs to Breasts.” Later, when presenting her research, scientists at the NIF asked if she could apply the same technology to detect damage in their laser optics. Since the powerful laser energies at NIF can degrade optics over time, her work became instrumental in creating a “recycle loop” to identify, repair, and reuse the delicate lenses and crystals.<br><br>What I found the most fascinating about her life story was just how interdisciplinary the tools she created and used were--her journey took her in using novel technologies in imaging and AI from bombs to breast cancer to laser optics. I am planning on majoring in Computer Engineering in college; this perspective&nbsp;opened my eyes to how flexible and far-reaching a technical foundation can be. As long as I develop a skillset, like Ms. Kegelmeyer did, I can apply those skills and tools to whichever field I find myself the most passionate for.<br></p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The talk (and comic book!) also really drew me into fusion and the prospect of working/studying energy engineering. It is still something that I need to do a lot more exploration with--the nuclear energy industry is not very easy to understand--but I'm fortunate to have this as another potential career route I can explore in my belt.</p>

                    Guest Speaker(s) #2: CSUEB MBA Students</h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">This presentation showcased three professionals pursuing their MBAs at CSUEB, each offering a glimpse into their careers. Tu Trinh from Illumina discussed the global impact of genome sequencing in healthcare and agriculture, Alejandro Jimenez from JP Morgan shared insights on managing securities and smart investing, and Edward Abaunza, a combat medic in the U.S. Army Reserve, spoke about providing critical medical support in military settings.<br><br>One key piece of advice that stuck with me came from Alejandro Jimenez, who stressed that “money not invested is an opportunity lost.” He encouraged us to treat finance as a science and to make strategic decisions to ensure our money is actively growing.<br><br>The career that stood out most to me was Tu Trinh’s. As an international technician for Illumina, he gets to travel the world while working on cutting-edge biotech innovations. I was especially drawn to his emphasis on soft skills and real-world performance over GPA. His job blends meaningful impact with global experiences, which is exactly what I’m looking for.<br><br>When I think about my future career, I know I’ll value travel and financial stability the most—especially early on. I want the freedom to explore the world before settling down, and having a strong financial foundation will give me the flexibility to do that. Work-life balance isn’t a major concern for me because I plan to (hopefully) pursue something I’m passionate about, so loving what I do will naturally make work feel fulfilling.<br><br>I do not have any pictures from this experience.</p>
